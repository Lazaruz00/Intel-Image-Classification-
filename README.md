# Intel-Image-Classification
This project involves building an image classification model from scratch and building another model using transfer learning with VGG16 model. 
The VGG16 model transfer learning model can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m-OojwstsE2aV1ftsd33xRT0ihigFT0J?usp=sharing
I have separated the intel images into train sets, test sets and validation sets.
